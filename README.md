# Rummy-Algorithm
The purpose of the developed algorithm is to determine the number of cards required to complete the required number of books and/or runs, given an existing hand of cards, as according to the rules of Shanghai Rummy.

A lightweight text-based UI is provided to the user so that they may intuitively interact with the algorithm, and build their hand of cards. Other quality-of-life commands are also provided.

The possible end uses of this algorithm include:
1. informing the actions taken by a CPU in a Shanghai Rummy program; or
2. informing the decisions of a human player in a real game.
